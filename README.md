# Distributed Algorithms Zoo #
Just a fun side project to learn a little bit more about distributed algorithms and their implementations in Java and Go


## The Fallacies of Distributed Computing ##
The network is reliable;
Latency is zero;
Bandwidth is infinite;
The network is secure;
Topology doesn't change;
There is one administrator;
Transport cost is zero;
The network is homogeneous;
